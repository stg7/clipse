# CLIPSE (clip-based image search engine) :mag: :sunrise:
A small image search :mag: engine using clip embeddings.
The overall idea is to provide a minimalistic search engine for images, which can be used locally for smaller datasets as they are for example used in research.

## requirements :wrench: 

* python 3 (tested with 3.12)
* uv (see [astral-uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for installation instructions)

## usage :computer:
Run `uv` to setup everything, e.g., the command `uv run build_index.py --help` should result in:

```
usage: build_index.py [-h] [--index_folder INDEX_FOLDER] image_folder

create clip index

positional arguments:
  image_folder          images to be processed

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --index_folder INDEX_FOLDER
                        folder for storing the clip features/index (default:
                        index)

```

`uv` ensures to setup all dependencies in a virtual environment.

## tools :rocket:
All included tools should be run with `uv run`.

* `build_index.py`: create an index based on a folder with images (recommended to downscale the images, e.g. to 480x480, or 480 as width and the height adjusted to the aspect ratio)
* `query.py`: command line interface to perform queries to an created index
* `server.py`: web interface


**Important**: For full-resolution access in the web-interface.
Independent of the input folder, where are images are stored without sub-directories, to create the index, the webserver expects the full-resolution images in the same substructure in the `full` directory.
E.g., your lower resolution image for indexing is `my-path/whateverpath/img.jpg` then the full-resolution variant will be expected to be stored in `full/whateverpath/img.jpg`.
So all tools assume images to be stored in subfolders of the root folder. 

### command line interface
<img src="research/imgs/CLI.jpg" width="400" />

### web interface
<img src="research/imgs/WEB.jpg" width="600" />
